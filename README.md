Term project for an industrial deisn course focusing on Critical Design at Emily Carr University
An arduino based, hand made, alalogue instrument, designed with kalimba-like playability paired with a piano-like note arrangement. Built in piezo microphones bring sound into an arduino guitar pedal that allows varrious effects, 6 availible effects to choose from with effect parameter knobs.
